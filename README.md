![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9b7b912-346d-463a-aa76-d7d09bb38c23)

*This repository contains a Python implementation for generating and interpolating an implied volatility (IV) surface using the Black-Scholes model.*
---

## Overview

- Computes European call option prices using the Black-Scholes formula.
- Calculates implied volatility from option prices.
- Creates a synthetic volatility surface and interpolates it for arbitrary strikes and maturities.
- Visualizes the resulting 3D implied volatility surface.

---

## Features

- BlackScholes pricing: `bs_call_price(S, K, T, r, sigma)`
- Implied volatility calculation `implied_vol(price, S, K, T, r)`
- Synthetic vol surface generation using a sine + exponential model.
- 3D visualization of strikes, maturities, and interpolated IV.

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```
